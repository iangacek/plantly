This is a Node.js application that utilizes RESTful API and a MongoDB back-end to look up plants and their care info on a React.js UI.

## Feature Overview
Recycle-It is a quick and easy way to locate recycling-facilities near you. The user simply puts in their zipcode, radius limit and material-type.

## Motivation
This game is part of the University of Minnesota's Web Application Development program in which students utilize their newly-found API retrieval abilities. Our team wanted a challenge so we decided to use a minimum of 3 APIs: Earth911, Granim.JS, and Google Earth Engine API. I felt it challenging yet rewarding to create functions capable of "cracking" into the complex databases of Earth911 and Google Maps. 

## Result
The result is an aesthetically simple design that users can use to quickly look up Recycling Facility addresses.
